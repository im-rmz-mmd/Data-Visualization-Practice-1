Data Visualization with MMD! 

In this project, I worked with random and synthetic data using the powerful tools Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal was to learn and explore different concepts of data visualization.
Not only did I learn a lot, but you can also get tons of ideas for your own projects! 

Project Outputs

This project is packed with awesome visualizations, each revealing interesting aspects of the data:

Patterns and trends (Line Chart)

Comparisons between categories (Bar Chart)

Proportions and percentages (Pie Chart)

Data relationships (Scatter Plot)

Line Chart

The first step was generating some random data using np.random.randint. I plotted a simple line chart with plt.plot to visualize patterns and trends over rows of data.
The X-axis was labeled "Row," and the Y-axis was labeled "Column" to make the plot clear and intuitive.

Bar Chart

I visualized some random data like Y and Z in a bar chart.
Bar charts are great for comparing values and identifying the highest or lowest values in a dataset.

Pie Chart

I created a simple dataframe with categories like "Cat," "Bee," "Dog," and more.
Using value_counts, I calculated the count of each category and plotted them in a pie chart.
I also used autopct='%1.1f%%' to display percentages, showing, for instance, that "Cats" had the highest count!

Scatter Plot

A scatter plot was used to visualize the relationship between two sets of random data.
I used marker='D' (diamond) to make the plot more visually appealing.
Scatter plots are perfect for exploring the relationships and correlations between datasets.

Advanced Bar Chart: Comparing Earnings

Here, I created two dataframes showing the age of individuals and their earnings across two months.
The data was visualized in a grouped bar chart with different colors (green and red) for better distinction.
This type of visualization is ideal for time-based comparisons or grouped data analysis.

Advanced Pie Chart

Finally, I created an advanced pie chart with random data.
To make it pop, I used explode to separate one slice from the rest and added shadow=True for a 3D effect.

Key Takeaway

Proper data visualization is a critical step in understanding and analyzing data.
This project helped me better understand how to transform raw data into meaningful and visually appealing insights.
If you're looking to improve your data visualization skills or want to make your data more intuitive and engaging, this project can be a great starting point!
